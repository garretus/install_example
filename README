=== Base to make a python script for linux command line ===

I have to develop several different bash commands for any linux distribution. I decided to program it with python.
This is my base repo to use as template for all of this commands.

```bash
$python test_ module.py
```

is not cool and i want to be executed like

```bash
$ test_module
```

... from https://wiki.python.org/moin/Distutils/Tutorial


1. Download/clone this repo

2. On the project directory:
 ```bash
 $ python setup.py sdist
